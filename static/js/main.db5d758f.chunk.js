No ports are open in Lodge's bastion host. Instead, Lodge uses AWS Systems Manager to authenticate user access with AWS credentials. This type of connection is called an SSM session, which users can initiate using the Lodge CLI. Once the SSM session has started in the bastion host, users can SSH into the Lodge components without searching for their IPs.
